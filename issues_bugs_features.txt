When creating the WZSound_Patch_Instructions when copying over the RWAVs I only should have ones that aren't too_big. The .patch file is correct
When creating the WZSound_Patch_Instructions both the .patch file and rwavs need to exclude files that are the same
Only enable buttons like Create Project BRWSD when you have the required files
Retype all text if needed
Rename all files/folder/variables to follow format if incorrect especially RWAV Extraction Instructions file names
Implement Convert Project button with it's 3 options
Rename generic "Instructions" as "RWAV Extraction Instructions" to be more distinct from WZSound Patcher Instructions
Have "Load Project" dropdown be sorted by last loaded
Add more RWAV Extraction Instructions
Change UI of Progress Bar to be better
Have some way to load your BRWSD or WZSound Patcher folders from the program
